MindSpace is a website that offers proactive wellness advice, carefully chosen resources, and private access to support for students' mental health. Through an easy-to-use, non-clinical interface, the platform seeks to connect students with institutional and external mental health services, promote a supportive community, and encourage others to ask for help.
